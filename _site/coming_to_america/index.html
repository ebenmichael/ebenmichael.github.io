        <p>This is a story about telephones. Missed and made calls, conversations between friends and colleagues, and the breakup of a decades long telecommunications monopoly. It’s also a story about how this branch of the Ben-Michael family came to America.</p>

<hr />

<p>One May eventing in 1993, the telephone rang in an empty Haifa apartment just down the hill from the Technion, Israel’s premier science and engineering institute. The short screeches from the phone were met with silence. Finally, the answering machine kicked in. Had an Israeli been calling, the answering tape would have recorded a few awkward breaths and the click of the line disconnecting. The devices were a novelty in Israel, and most Israelis simply didn’t know what to say to a piece of tape. This time, however, the call had to travel thousands of miles across undersea cables to connect the caller in Holmdel, New Jersey to a quiet spool of tape.</p>

<!---The answering machine was also a novelty for my parents. Thanks to high import duties and a monopoly on imports, electronic consumer products were prohibitively expensive in Israel. A few years earlier, my parents went on a road trip through America, and like most Israelis who traveled to America, they came ready to buy. In Seattle they picked up an answering machine-->

<p>Later that evening, my parents came home to a strange sight: their forever dormant answering machine had a slowly blinking red light.</p>

<hr />

<p>Two months earlier those same cables carried a different international call. My Dad’s junior advisor called up his old colleague Uzi from Bell Labs to discuss a possible post doc position for his student. He talked my Dad up for a bit and by the end of the conversation Uzi decided to give my Dad a call.</p>

<p>Another international call was patched through and the same undersea cables connected an esteemed researcher to a ringing phone in a dusty PhD student office. This office was nearly never occupied: the physics PhD students who were nominally assigned this office spent almost all of their time in the lab, and who ever calls these guys anyway? This time, however, my Dad happened to be sitting at his desk when the phone rang. Bewildered, he answered the phone and found himself in an interview.</p>

<p>The call went well, and several weeks later when Uzi came to Israel to visit family he dropped in on my Dad. He liked my Dad, and wanted to hire him. However, thanks to a consent decree in U.S. federal court, it wouldn’t be that easy.</p>

<hr />

<p>In 1880, Alexander Graham Bell, in an early example of government funded research, received a 40,000 Franc prize (over $4,000,000 today) from the French government for the invention of the telephone. Bell took the French money back to the U.S. and built a laboratory dedicated to the transmission of sound. 45 years later, the massive monopoly which grew out of Bell’s telephone, AT&amp;T, combined several subsidiary R&amp;D labs to form Bell Labs, the name an homage to Bell and his prize-funded laboratory. Fat with monopoly profits, AT&amp;T could afford to pour money into Bell Labs as it grew into the world’s greatest industrial R&amp;D lab.</p>

<p>Researchers at Bell Labs invented the transistor, created the C programming language, founded information theory, and discovered the cosmic microwave background, to name a small fraction of their discoveries. From the computers and phones we carry with us, to the drones that watch us, to our very understanding of the universe, much of the making of the modern world owes itself to Bell Labs and all that monopoly money.</p>

<p>Everything changed when the U.S. federal government finally opened up its anti-trust books. Since 1913 the federal government had essentially allowed AT&amp;T to be a monopoly, but in 1974 the U.S. opened an anti-trust case against the company. AT&amp;T had most of the telecommunications industry’s market share, but it was also vertically integrated: Western Electric, a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&amp;T was its sole provider of telephone equipment. The government suspected that AT&amp;T was using profits from Western Electric to subsidize the cost of its local telephone service, and in 1982 AT&amp;T settled without admitting guilt.</p>

<p>As part of the settlement, AT&amp;T was broken up into regional telephone companies. The rump that remained still owned Bell Labs, and that rump couldn’t sustain it. Without the massive influx of cash, Bell Labs started to shrink, and basic research was being cut. Researchers in fields deemed unimportant to the business began to starve for funding, and eventually scattered to the various ivory towers of the north east. It was in all this uncertainty that my Dad met with Uzi.</p>

<hr />

<p>For months my parents were in limbo. Would Uzi get the funding for a post-doc or not? Would they be picking up their lives and moving across the world or not? Would they come to America or not? Finally on that May evening they got their answer. A Bell Labs HR rep</p>
